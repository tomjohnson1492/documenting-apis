Now it's time to explore some other REST APIs and code for some specific scenarios. This experience will give you more exposure to different REST APIs, how they're organized, the complexities and interdependency of endpoints, and more.

## Attack the challenge first, then read the answer
There are several examples with different APIs. A challenge is listed for each exercise. First try to solve the challenge on your own. Then follow along in the sections below to see how I approached it.

In these examples, I usually printed the code to a web page to visualize the response. However, that part is not required in the challenge. (It mostly makes the exercise more fun to me.)

## Shortcuts for API keys
Each API requires you to use an API key, token, or some other form of authentication. You can register for your own API keys, or you can [use my keys here](http://idratherbewriting.com/files/restapicourse/apikeys.txt).

## Swap out APIKEY in code samples
I never insert API keys in code samples for a few reasons:

* API keys expire
* API keys posted online get abused
* Customizing the code sample is a good thing

When you see `APIKEY` in a code sample, remember to swap in an API key there. For example, if the API key was `123`, you would delete `APIKEY` and use `123`.
