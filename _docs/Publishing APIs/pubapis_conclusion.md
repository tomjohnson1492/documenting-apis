Congratulations, you finished the Publishing API Docs course. By now, you should have a solid understanding of the variety and possibilities for publishing API documentation.

At this point, think about your requirements, your audience, and try to pick the right tools for your situation.

## Questions to consider
Here are a few questions to consider:

* Will developers be writing or contributing to the content?
* Does your security group restrict you from using third-party platforms to host documentation?
* Do you have a budget to pay a third-party platform for hosting?
* Do you want to manage the web platform details yourself or offload this onto another group/company?
* How many endpoints do you have to document?
* Should you push documentation from the source into your documentation?
* Does the documentation need be visible on the web, or does it need to be private?
* To what extent do you want customers to have a one-stop-shopping experience &mdash; reading docs, logging support tickets, posting to forums, viewing news?
* Do you have UX resources to help build a custom solution?

## What publishing tools did you choose?

I'm curious to know what publishing tools you chose. There are many options, and I could only cover a fraction of them during this course. <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/contact">Drop me a note</a> to let me know what publishing tool or platform you're using, and how it's working out.
