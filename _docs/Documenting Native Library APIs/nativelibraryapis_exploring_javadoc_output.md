## About the Javadoc output

The Javadoc output hasn't changed much in the past 20 years, so in some sense it's predictable and familiar. On the other hand, the output is dated and lacks some critical features, like search, or the ability to add more pages. Anyway, it is what it is.

## Class summary

The class summary page shows a short version of each of the classes. The description you write for each class (up to the period) appears here. It's kind of like a quick reference guide for the API.

You click a class name to dive into the details.

## Class details

When you view a class page, you're presented with a brief summary of the fields, constructors, and methods for the class. Again this is just an overview. When you scroll down, you can see the full details about each of them.

## Other navigation

If you click **Package** at the top, you can also browse the classes by package. Or you can go to the classes by clicking the class name in the left column. You can also browse everything by clicking the **Index** link.
